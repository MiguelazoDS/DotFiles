# Which resampling method to use.  There are a few methods of resampling

#
# but briefly, the following methods are based on bandlimited interpolation
# and are higher quality, but also slower:
#
#    SincBestQuality   - really slow (I know you probably have an xx GHz
#                        processor, but it's still not enough to not see
#                        this in the top output :)  The worst case
#                        Signal-to-Noise Ratio is 97dB.
#    SincMediumQuality - much faster.
#    SincFastest       - the fastest bandlimited interpolation.
#
# And these are lower quality, but much faster methods:
#
#    ZeroOrderHold - really poor quality, but it's really fast.
#    Linear - a bit better and a bit slower.

#ResampleMethod = Linear
